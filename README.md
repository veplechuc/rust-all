# rust_tuto

This repository contains various examples and tutorials to learn and practice Rust programming. Below are the different options and features currently being worked on:

## Options

1. **Variables and Mutability**:
   - Examples demonstrating how to declare and use variables in Rust.
   - Covers mutable and immutable variables.

2. **Functions**:
   - Examples of defining and calling functions.
   - Includes parameter passing and return values.

3. **Ownership and Borrowing**:
   - Illustrates Rust's ownership model.
   - Examples of borrowing and references.

4. **Control Flow**:
   - Demonstrates `if`, `else`, `match`, and loops.

5. **Collections**:
   - Examples of using vectors, strings, and hash maps.

6. **Error Handling**:
   - Covers `Result` and `Option` types for error handling.

## Running the Examples

The examples are located in the `src/bin` directory. Each file in this directory is treated as a separate binary crate. To run a specific example, use the following command:

```bash
cargo run --bin <filename>


## Work in Progress

This project is a work in progress. More examples and features will be added over time. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with the examples to deepen your understanding of Rust.
